          <h1>Crowdsourcing Law and Policy<br /><small>CSCW 2017 Workshop on Crowd-Civic Systems</small></h1>
          <p>We invite you to <mark><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/zpAQMkyZjAe53mwj1" target="_blank">participate</a></mark> in a <mark><a href="https://cscw.acm.org/2017/" target="_blank">Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) 2017 Workshop</a></mark> 
            designed to explore the risks and evaluation strategies for crowdsourcing law and policy. Crowdsourcing 
            technologies, strategies and methods offer new opportunities for bridging existing gaps among law, policymaking, 
            and the lived experience of citizens. In recent years, a number of initiatives across the world have applied 
            crowdsourcing to contexts including constitutional reform, drafting federal bills, and generating local policies. 
            However, crowd-civic systems also come with challenges and risks such as socio-technical barriers, marginalization 
            of specific groups, silencing of interests, etc.</p>
          <p>Participants in this workshop will apply a design-thinking approach to conceptualize the future of crowd-civic systems:
            (1) what the public can accomplish, identifying best practices, e.g., risks, strategies for evaluation, (2) how people
            (from policymakers to stakeholder interest groups) value in system processes and outcomes, and (3) when crowdsourcing 
            law and policy poses more risk than potential value.</p>

          <h2>Workshop Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            In this workshop our focus is on crowd-civic systems that inform the policy-making process, when the policy itself is 
            still ripe for change and input. The experience of existing systems raises several important questions about how 
            crowdsourcing could be used as a tool for civic engagement in this context.
          </p>
          <h4>Critical questions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Whose views are prioritized?</li>
            <li>How could policymakers and participants use the results of a crowd-civic system?</li>
            <li>How can we compare the performance of various crowd-civic systems?</li>
            <li>When is it not recommended to crowdsource law and policy?</li>
            <li>What can emerging online collective action teach us about crowd-civic system design?</li>
            <li>How might we use hypotheticals and futuring exercises to generate insights into the promise and perils of crowd-civic systems design?</li>
            <li>What socio-technical factors, barriers and risks should policymakers and designers consider as we move toward a wider adoption of crowd-civic systems?</li>            
          </ul>
          <h4>Development of a best practices guidebook</h4>
          <p>The workshop seeks to address some of these questions by gathering a diverse group of participants, with a broad range
            of perspectives, to work collaboratively toward the future of crowd-civic systems for policy and law.  We will do so by
            developing a best practices guide for crowd-civic system design and research, drawing from both the public and private
            spheres, in an effort to promote crowdsourcing as an adaptive, viable, robust, and reliable tool for civic engagement.

          <h2>Tentative schedule of workshop activities</h2>
          <p>The workshop will be a full-day of exploration into the critical design of crowd civic systems. The first part of 
            the day includes activities toward reaching a common ground around conceptualization of crowd-civic systems for 
            law and policy. The second part of the day includes activities toward identifying best practices in design, 
            research, and application of such systems.</p>
