          <h2>A Design-Thinking Approach to Crowd-Civic Systems</h2>
          <p>We invite you to <a href="#apply">participate</a> in a Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) 2017 Workshop 
            designed to explore the risks and evaluation strategies for crowdsourcing law and policy. Crowdsourcing 
            technologies, strategies and methods offer new opportunities for bridging existing gaps among law, policymaking, 
            and the lived experience of citizens. In recent years, a number of initiatives across the world have applied 
            crowdsourcing to contexts including constitutional reform, drafting federal bills, and generating local policies. 
            However, crowd-civic systems also come with challenges and risks such as socio-technical barriers, marginalization 
            of specific groups, silencing of interests, etc. Using a design-thinking approach, this workshop will address both 
            opportunities and challenges of crowd-civic systems to develop best practices for increasing public engagement with 
            law and policy. The workshop organizers will suggest an initial framework explicitly intended to be criticized by 
            participants and reconfigured through a series of iterative cooperative small-group activities focusing on 
            ``diagnosing'' the failures of past crowd-civic system efforts and the successes of online action around social 
            issues. While the ultimate objective of the workshop is to develop a best practices guide, we see iterations on 
            the guide as a mechanism for fostering community and collaboration among policymakers, technologists, and researchers 
            around crowd-civic systems for law and policy.</p>
