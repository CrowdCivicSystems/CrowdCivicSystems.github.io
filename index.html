          <h1>Crowdsourcing Law and Policy</h1>
          <h2><small>A Design-Thinking Approach to Crowd-Civic Systems</small></h2>
          <p>We invite you to <mark><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/zpAQMkyZjAe53mwj1" target="_blank">participate</a></mark> in a Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) 2017 Workshop 
            designed to explore the risks and evaluation strategies for crowdsourcing law and policy. Crowdsourcing 
            technologies, strategies and methods offer new opportunities for bridging existing gaps among law, policymaking, 
            and the lived experience of citizens. In recent years, a number of initiatives across the world have applied 
            crowdsourcing to contexts including constitutional reform, drafting federal bills, and generating local policies. 
            However, crowd-civic systems also come with challenges and risks such as socio-technical barriers, marginalization 
            of specific groups, silencing of interests, etc.</p>
          <p>Using a design-thinking approach, this workshop will address both 
            opportunities and challenges of crowd-civic systems to develop best practices for increasing public engagement with 
            law and policy. The workshop organizers will suggest an initial framework explicitly intended to be criticized by 
            participants and reconfigured through a series of iterative cooperative small-group activities focusing on 
            <i>diagnosing</i> the failures of past crowd-civic system efforts and the successes of online action around social 
            issues. While the ultimate objective of the workshop is to develop a best practices guide, we see iterations on 
            the guide as a mechanism for fostering community and collaboration among policymakers, technologists, and researchers 
            around crowd-civic systems for law and policy.</p>

          <h2>Workshop Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            In this workshop our focus is on crowd-civic systems that inform the policy-making process, when the policy itself is 
            still ripe for change and input. The experience of existing systems raises several important questions about how 
            crowdsourcing could be used as a tool for civic engagement in this context.
          </p>
          <h4>Critical questions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Whose views are prioritized?</li>
            <li>How could policymakers and participants use the results of a crowd-civic system?</li>
            <li>How can we compare the performance of various crowd-civic systems?</li>
            <li>When is it not recommended to crowdsource law and policy?</li>
            <li>What can emerging online collective action teach us about crowd-civic system design?</li>
            <li>How might we use hypotheticals and futuring exercises to generate insights into the promise and perils of crowd-civic systems design?</li>
            <li>What socio-technical factors, barriers and risks should policymakers and designers consider as we move toward a wider adoption of crowd-civic systems?</li>            
          </ul>
          <h4>Development of a best practices guidebook</h4>
          <p>The workshop seeks to address some of these questions by gathering a diverse group of participants, with a broad range
            of perspectives, to work collaboratively toward the future of crowd-civic systems for policy and law.  We will do so by
            developing a best practices guide for crowd-civic system design and research, drawing from both the public and private
            spheres, in an effort to promote crowdsourcing as an adaptive, viable, robust, and reliable tool for civic engagement.
